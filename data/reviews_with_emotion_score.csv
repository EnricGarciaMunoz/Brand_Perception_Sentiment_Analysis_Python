D Soro,773 reviews,CA,4 days ago,"North American buyers bewareNorth American buyers bewareThese guys have very very shady marketing/sales tactics.In this day and age, all companies should have geo specific site pages.They boast ‚Äúfree exchanges‚Äù on site and at check-out, but when you read the faq fine print (a different page that I discovered after) it only applies to European residents.Shipping is moronic. They give two options, one cheaper, the second DHL. They should only offer DHL as the import/custom fees are astronomical with the base shipping, making the ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù just normal priceThe jerseys are decent quality (only reason why it‚Äôs not 1 star), but it‚Äôs not worth it. After the fees I should have just stuck to ordering Rapha.Oh, their service team will respond to you but they give zero f‚Äôs. The responses are essentially ‚Äútoo bad for you.‚ÄùDate of experience: August 05, 2024",2,-0.05,0.51

Lukasz,1 review,PL,"May 29, 2024","No problems with customer serviceI read some negative opinions regarding customer service, so I was a little bit concerned with ordering from Siroko. I ordered two sizes with intention to keep the better fit and return the other one. I had no problem whatsoever - I got stuff quickly (to Poland), had no problem with returning part of the order (one item) and got the refund quickly as well. Maybe the past problems are solved now, so I wanted to provide a positive review for Siroko.Date of experience: May 29, 2024",5,0.1,0.44

It is unusable now, only had it for a month.Wrote and email with attached pictures, they said it is wear and tear, warranty does not cover it, and offered me 8euro credit, which I still havent recived. And they also sent me the how to take care of the glasses instructions, it says ""Do not leave your glasses exposed in areas of intense heat.""So its a sport SUNglass, that cannot handle the sun.

customer,12 reviews,US,"Nov 6, 2023","Perfect service, design, and fit!I saw these jerseys were all ‚Äòrace‚Äô cut and due to bad experience in the past with too-tight fits I ordered one size larger than the guide recommended. They came and were clearly too large, mainly in the sleeve and torso length.  I was able to send them back at no charge and they were replaced with the smaller size which actually fit perfectly - not loose by any means but not so tight that it restricts breathing as other jerseys have done. They look and feel good. The fabrics are amazingly stretchy in both directions and very supple. The colors and patterns are far better than other companies have.

Steve Oliver,1 review,GB,"Jul 15, 2024","Terrible product and insulting attitudeBought some Siroko sunglasses (K3 California) a few weeks ago.  The third time I wore them while running it started to drizzle and the mirrored coating on the lens literally started bubbling and peeling off - 50% of the coating has gone and the glasses are completely ruined.  I had flecks of orange metallic coating all over my face.I contacted Siroko with pictures of the glasses and the damage caused.  They replied saying this is ""normal wear and tear"" but offered a 6 euro credit.  A complete insult.  I've never had this happen to sunglasses before, even the cheapest ones - but these were ¬£40.I'm going to have to try and get a refund from the bank but I'd advise people to stay well clear of this company.Date of experience: July 15, 2024",1,-0.22,0.49

Kristofor McGhee,1 review,AU,"Jun 5, 2024","SirokoSiroko. Absolutely infuriating! I wouldn't recommend this cycle brand to my worst enemy. Their so-called ""popular"" products are nothing but substandard junk. Imagine spending your hard-earned cash on apparel only for it to fall apart after a few uses. It's a disgrace! Save yourself the headache and invest in a brand that actually values quality over quick sales. Siroko is a total letdown and a waste of money.

Phill ,1 review,GB,"Jun 22, 2023","After watching YouTube videos reviewing‚Ä¶After watching YouTube videos reviewing and giving sizing information on Siroko cycling clothing I sized as normal with SRX shorts but sized down smaller a size with a SRX jersey. I have worn Al√© exclusively since 2014 and have been reluctant to try anything else but I'm genuinely pleased I did, I'm so happy with my purchase. I ordered only two items and a bidon just to make sure I got my sizing correct, now I know what I need I can't wait to buy other kit variants. Exceptional quality and price is extremely competitive and I don't feel I'm being ripped off, which ultimately means I will still spend but just get more for my money. Regarding delivery - I ordered on Monday at just before 2pm. It was delivered to me in the UK by Wednesday 12pm, that's outrageous service - I couldn't get on a plane to Spain and back in that time. I really hope this level of service and quality continues, please Siroko do not sell out and change my faith in cycling businesses has been restored!Date of experience: June 21, 2023",5,0.13,0.69

Emma,27K reviews,GB,"Mar 28, 2024","AVOID!!! Shocking customer service Firstly the sizing, I spent ¬£250 on a ski jacket, overalls and an underlayer in size small and they‚Äôre all huge! Definitely not your standard sizing. THEN! I couldn‚Äôt return the items as I was out of the country meaning that I was just outside of the 14days. They still sell the items on the website for the same price, the tags are still on them and I was wanting to keep one of the items but they couldn‚Äôt care less and just redirected me to their policy page ending with a have a nice day :) The customer service is sooooooo pooor as is their return policy. I have never experienced anything like it with any company, makes me think they‚Äôre going broke and want to get rid of as much stock as they can with no interest in customer satisfaction.

Patricia,1 review,NL,"Mar 28, 2024","DON'T DO ITI wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews here. The ski jacket and pants I bought were WAY too big. I bought both M and L. And even the M was way too big. And I am a tall woman at 178 cm. It seems Siroko does not differentiate between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sizes. I received ski clothes right before our ski trip. Unfortunately I did not manage to return them before we left on vacation and therefore missed the 2-week window for returns. Two weeks is a very short timeframe for online returns and not according to industry standards. Basically the Siroko company knows that a lot of people will be left with products they don‚Äôt want but can no longer return. I have written to Siroko three times asking for help with this. A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  If you are considering buying from Siroko, DON‚ÄôT DO IT.  Date of experience: March 28, 2024",1,0.02,0.36
Mark Fletcher,3 reviews,GB,"Feb 23, 2024","Peeling sunglasses coatingWhile I was initially impressed with the fit and experience with Siroko‚Äôs cycling sunglasses, this was short lived. After roughly 10 times using them, and always cleaning gently with the supplied cloth case and placing in the hard case after use, the reflective coating started to peel away.It took 10 days for Siroko customer service to get in touch, in which they said that accidental scratches were not covered by warranty; however there were no scratches, simply the peeling reflective coating that seemed to be a manufacturing defect. Rather than replace the lenses, they only offered a ‚Ç¨5 credit to purchase something else. There‚Äôs a reason why these are so highly discounted on their website all the time - definitely not worth the money for the limited longevity of these.Date of experience: February 23, 2024",1,0.1,0.51

Michele,1 review,IT,"Jun 2, 2024","Customer service doesn't answer at all - be careful - always ask for a refund on your cardI bought a couple of cycling jerseys from this site because this brand was advertised by a youtuber and I liked the minimalistic design. The experience was less than good.Cons:- the expected time of delivery is completely misleading;- sizes are too small (I usually wear an L, their XXL is small for me). Also don't trust their suggested size, instead check your body measure and the table provided to find the size (yet you probably need a bigger size anyway);- so far the quality of the jerseys seems to be average, or slightly below average;- even with what was a ""big"" sale discount, a referral link and an added discount code, the quality/price ratio is on the low end;- you can try to contact them, but they will simply ignore your messages. I had to block a payment with my bank because they wouldn't answer to my requests;- if you need a refund always ask to put it back on your card despite they try to suggest to have your money immediately available on your ""wallet"";- the site has some bugs: as a registered user I was shown a message that said the discount code could be used in ""the next page"" but that was not true;- they pretend to have irresistible limited sales to lure you into buying, but it seems it's just their policy to show big discounts all the times. Pro:- if the size of your product is wrong you can choose a different size and change it for free (you just need to print a return label and send the packet);Date of experience: April 15, 2024",1,-0.03,0.42
Em,13 reviews,GB,"Mar 25, 2024","Caught out by short returns periodCaught out by short returns period. I had never purchased from Siroko before so didn't know what size cycling jersey I would be. I therefore ordered two sizes to arrive in time for my holiday. I kept the one that fit and then packaged the other up to return. I didn't have time to return this before I went away and thought it would be fine to return once I got home. However, unlike most retailers who offer a 28 day returns period they only offer a 14 day returns period. I was outside of this admittedly, as I never read the returns policy - Who does?! However, the jersey that doesn't fit is brand new, in the packaging and still sold on the website and they will not let me return it! This is incredibly frustrating as it will inevitably sit in a drawer unused. ¬£36 down the drain. I had never ordered from Siroko before and used an influencers referral link as the clothes looked good quality. I wont be ordering from them again as this has left a sour taste in my mouth.

Lewis Burgess,2 reviews,GB,"Jan 27, 2024","Poor/non existent customer serviceI placed an order with Siroko on 11th of January, paid for quicker DHL delivery to arrive latest 15th due to the weekend. It got lost by DHL, not Sirokos fault, so I contacted them as the merchant to ask for a refund on the delivery cost as I feel if you pay extra for guaranteed service you should get value for the extra amount or should get your money back in my opinion but still nearly 2 weeks later still no reply. I have since been contacted directly by DHL who have somehow sent the parcel to Brazil instead of the UK by mistake and its now trapped in Brazilian customs. Again, completely understand this is not Sirokos fault. What my poor review is for is that i've tried to make contact with Siroko on numerous occasions about this issue via the contact us section on their website and I've received the automated ""We've received your email"" email both times but haven't recieved any contact back from them whatsoever.

Mariana Storto,27K reviews,IE,"Jan 17, 2024","Siroko sent me my order with an important missing itemThis is my story with Siroko: I fell in love with the brand when I was searching for snowboarding gear, I made a significant purchase on your website and already had planned other purchases because the design and the quality were outstanding in my opinion. Also, they have express deliveries (which are a big plus when it comes to buying gear since some of the websites can take weeks to deliver the products).Well, I bought some 5 products and I waited anxiously for them to arrive.Imagine my surprise when I got my package and one of the outer layers that I ordered was missing.I immediately contacted the support, and had to wait 24 hours for them to get back to me, they asked me for pictures of the products that were delivered, waited for a few more hours and, only then, did they tell me that the product had a ""manufacturing defect"" and was just removed from the website.If there are any problems with the product, this should've been pointed out to me from the beginning. Instead, they decided to send me my purchase as if nothing was missing, waited for me to open a ticket, asked for more proof, and, only then, after a huge effort from my end, gave me an explanation and presented me with options (refund or choose another jacket, which wouldn't arrive in time for my trip). This could have been avoided from the beginning if Siroko had been more transparent about the manufacturing problem with the product. Instead, they let me build my expectations around the outer layer, I lost more than an hour having to deal with this problem, and caused plenty of anxiety ‚Äî because, I'm traveling on Saturday morning and now I‚Äôll have to sort out a new outer layer (in a country that doesn‚Äôt have good stores for snowboarding and ski products).I want to make it clear that my frustration is with the way the brand dealt with the problem, not with the support or the quality of the products.Date of experience: January 17, 2024",1,0.19,0.54

I brought a wildly overpriced thermal base layer shirt that was dubiously alluded to being a full base layer (top + bottom) on the site. On having the item delivered I returned immediately only to be told 2 weeks later that I had to pay an additional import tax on top of my original postal cost to return (somewhere north of ¬£30). On contesting the fee (which is not mentioned anywhere on their site or returns policy), Siroko simply shipped the item back to me and ignored all further communication.Some of the worst customer service I've had from an online company.

Karine,5 reviews,GB,"Nov 20, 2022","Do not order if there is any risk that you might need to returnI ordered a couple of items from Siroko. They took weeks to come but I was not in a hurry. One of the items did not fit though and I needed to return it. Like many others, I was furious when, after filling out the correct CN22 form and believing that no further taxes were due because of the low value of the item, I received an email from Siroko stating that I needed to pay ‚Ç¨15.70 of taxes. After requesting a copy of the request from Correa, I did mot research and cconclude that Siroko was correct. Once I paid the tax to the PayPal account indicated in the Siroko email, I got the refund promptly. Sadly, I will not order again from Siroko (or any company based in Spain) as, by the time I paid postage and the taxes, I did not get even half of what I had paid. Also, Siroko should be clearer about the fact that the additional taxes are over 40% of the item value.Date of experience: November 04, 2022",2,-0.07,0.46

Andrew Bradshaw,1 review,GB,"Oct 14, 2022","Worst company I have ever dealt withWorst company I have ever dealt with. I immediately complained about a faulty garment, asking them to send a pre-paid barcode so that I could return for a refund. After initially being ignored they finally asked for photos of the issue, which by law I am not required to provide. However, I did so and they rejected that the zipper was faulty. I then sent a video. And again they rejected my claim, but asked me to send the garment to them at my own cost, commenting that the time period for a refund had expired. Not true for a faulty garment! And the delay was due to their refusal to admit liability. Now they are refusing to repay postal fee. Someone at Siroko needs to take legal advice as they do not understand european consumer legislation.

I even took a little spill with the rain jacket on some wet asphalt and the material didn't rip. The jersey I got fits great and feels better than all my other jerseys.

I was already excited to get this great designed shirt but when I got it on me, that was a new experience for me.. what a quality and so nice to wear. Lot different then other shirts I got from another shops. It was love at first sight :-)From now on I always order my shirts there on siroko. I got 2 new shirts ordered, short sleeved, looking forward to it :-)The only thing they may improve in my opinion is more colours and more combining shirt with shorts. So you can have a total kit.

Brian,1 review,US,"Apr 28, 2022","Thanks to Jasper Verkuijl!I‚Äôm a gravel cyclist and I am a fan of Jasper Verkuijl‚Äôs YouTube channel. Jasper spoke highly of the Siroko sunglasses and I thought I‚Äôd give them a try. I ordered a pair of the k3s and the fit and function is fantastic! They are lightweight and stylish. Compared to my other name brand sunglasses they seem to be more durable and much lighter. I can take the k3s glasses off and stick them in my helmet without worrying about them falling off (on a long climb I need to take the glasses off because of sweat, for instance).I do like the photo chromatic lenses which reduced the need for several different  lenses to meet changing light conditions. The clarity of Siroko lenses is simply fantastic and something that stood out to me right away.  I did purchase the adapter for prescription lenses and will try that later this year (when I can use leftover medical expense account funds). I was very impressed with the K3s sunglasses that I purchased another two pairs! The shipping was unbelievably fast delivery especially given how difficult with the current supply/shipping issues.Again, Siroko has been impressive and has great value for the price. You cannot get the same quality and value in name brand sunglasses for the price that Siroko offers.Date of experience: April 28, 2022",5,0.24,0.55

I send an e-mail right away but didn't received an answer. When they was delevered the guy from DHL told the company SIROKO had specified the package wrong in the system and therefore the goggles was receved too late. Nothing about excuses as ""working hours"" or ""working days"". I send another e-mail to SIROKO and was told that my package was delevered in the right time. I have tried many times to explaine my case - I was NOT given the product I payed for. They will not pay me back and stand up for their mistake. I will never buy another thing from their company.

But the worst thing (which I never had with any of other brand jerseys) is that when I sweat, I can really see all of the white ""salts"" appearing everywhere on the fabric and especially on the arms.So stay away.The only ""good"" thing is that the delivery was really fast and arrived in 2 days.Date of experience: November 17, 2021",1,0.08,0.51
John,1 review,GB,"Updated Nov 5, 2021","Bad sizing info and awful returns policyAs a UK buyer, I fell foul of the same issue previous reviewers have, in the prohibitive cost of return and incorrect sizing.I bought a Medium cycling jacket based on the sizing info listed on the website but when it arrived, it was so small the two sides of the zip wouldn't even meet to do up! I contacted Siroko to exchange the item, hoping it would be nice and easy to return the jacket and get a new one sent (given that is was their fault the jacket didn't fit), however I got a largely copy and paste response saying I would bear all return postage and customs fees to return it to Spain. It's pretty much pointless sending it back in that case, as the cost to do so would be nearly as much as the jacket cost.It's a shame, as the jacket looks smart and seemed pretty good quality, so I would have bought much more kit from them in future but now I won't take the chance, mainly due to the very poor after sales service but also in case anything else is mis-sized.Date of experience: November 05, 2021",1,0.04,0.53

Ben Kinkaid,4 reviews,GB,"May 28, 2021","Premium Feel Sunglasses at Great PriceOrdered the photochromic K3S sunglasses for cycling. Was a bit hesitant about quality at the price point but I shouldn't have worried! They arrived early (always nice) and everything from packaging to product had a really premium feel. The glasses themselves are just as pictured online, incredibly light weight (to the point of being able to forget they're on your face), and I really like the slick and racier design of the K3S model. The harder carry case is a good size with space for spare lenses alongside the included spare nose and side grips. Literally the only thing I could fault is that it's a bit of a squeeze to get the glasses in the cloth case but they do fit with a bit of wiggling and it's probably better that it's secure in there to prevent lenses getting scratched.All in all great quality product at unbeatable price.Date of experience: May 28, 2021",5,0.36,0.53

Siriko charged me ¬£9.00 to post the sunglasses originally and when I tried to return them they said they would not pay the postage, so another ¬£9.00. Siriko said they would only provide a refund if the glasses were faulty. Well they are, they bounce on my face which the advert stated ‚Äústay in place, no movement‚Äù and the colour is nothing like the picture advertised.I will be adding this review to my online running sites to ensure other runners & cyclists don‚Äôt fall for the same advertisement & lose their money too.Date of experience: May 25, 2021",1,0.05,0.46

Raymond,1 review,PH,"Apr 15, 2021","Fabulous jerseys, but beyond that, excellent customer serviceI had purchased a Siroko SRX Veleta jersey upon recommendation of a friend. It arrived three (3) days after i ordered it, which was stupendously fast considering that the item came from Oviedo, Spain and had to travel halfway around the world to the Philippines.When the jersey arrived, i found the material of extremely high quality, and fit was really racefit. It, however, had one problem ‚Äî the left sleeve had a tear which i felt would become worse once i washed it.I immediately sent an email about my problem and asked for a possible replacement. I was, in all honesty, not expecting a response. To my surprise, Siroko replied the following day and, after asking for a photo of the item to confirm the model, quickly apologized and sent me the replacement.This outstanding customer service has given me reason to trust Siroko. I have since purchased 2 more SRX jerseys ‚Äî and they are on the way to Manila as i type this.Cheers, Siroko! Keep up the good work!Date of experience: April 15, 2021",5,0.29,0.57

Dotty Bouck-Standen,1 review,GB,"Jan 19, 2021","All in all an excellent product when bought at the discounted priceI got the K3 with photochromic lenses, for cycling on days when it's mostly cloudy but with chances of sunshine. They didn't disappoint! Came in a lovely box with a bag and hard case to protect the glasses. The lens shape is perfect for cycling - especially in TT position, the lens is large enough so you don't keep looking at the rim and wide enough not to experience any draft in your eyes. Despite not having adjustable nose pads they didn't slide too much. Photochromic lens is decent - maybe a bit dark when it's really overcast, but I have experienced that only significantly more expensive lenses have a really decent photochromic range.... All in all, an excellent product at the discounted price. One star deduction for following reason: If I had paid full price I would have been disappointed at the lack of adjustability, ""plasticky"" feel and no-name lens (never the less a good one!). Compared to other 100EUR cycling glasses I have from a Swedish brand these feel right to be priced around 50EUR rather than what they retail at.Date of experience: January 19, 2021",4,0.21,0.59

However, it is near impossible to exchange the lenses without either damaging the frame, the lens, or your fingers. BIG minus. The photochromatic blue lens is more or less not working. The bummer is the shipment and return policy. Living in Switzerland, I was charged additional 25 CHF for customs handling by DHL. This was not flagged before. Note: not for customs duties, hist for DHL handling, on top pf the shipment costs. When I opteb for my legal 14 days return right, Siroko infomed me that I had to send back at own costs.

Firstly, the clothing ordered (jersey, two vests and sunglasses) all fit perfectly and are of good quality. I found the website guide on how to decide what size clothing to buy to be very helpful (and accurate - what I ordered is exactly what I wanted/expected). Secondly, service was very quick - from order to delivery, less than a week. Thirdly, the customer service was excellent - a member of the Siroko team made contact to check I was happy with my order. In an age where customers have less and less contact with business, this was a breath of fresh air. Will definitely order from Siroko again!Date of experience: December 08, 2020",5,0.34,0.49

Jernej Po≈æenel,4 reviews,SI,"Updated Oct 31, 2020","Good jersey, mediocre glasses. Misleading discount marketing!I bought a Tirol jersey from them and K3 PhotoChromic Los Machucos glasses over a year ago.The jersey is good, very tight fitting and looks great. I love the zipped pocket at the back to put in money/credit card without worrying to lose it. Not every jersey has that feature. The only complaint is that the pockets are too small for longer rides where I need to stuff tons of energy bars in them, though I think they fixed that on their M2 (second version) jerseys and the front panel is made out of spandex which makes it fit great but gets a bit hot in temperatures over 27C. The material on the back panel is much nicer feeling and more breathable though :) Durability is good I rode it once or twice almost every week for entire year and it still looks like new.The photochromatic glasses were alright. I rode them entire winter and it was a put on and forget experience üëç. They are comfortable and stick really well to the face and won't fall off. Unfortunately I lost them in the forest so then I bought their K3 Riedberg glasses which I don't like as much as I did my other ones. The lens doesn't seem to be as good as the photocromatic ones. Sometimes there is this weird difraction effect where things reflecting light in a certain way would look really bright through the glasses like cracks in the road or railfences. When I rode in the evening I had to take them off quite quickly to see anything when it was getting dark. And also after half a year of use there's a few spots on the glasses now where it seems like it lost some coating  (though it's not visible when you're looking through them) even though I was only washing them with water as instructed and sometimes some handsoap to get the sweat off.Another thing is I hate how they do their marketing. I check their website multiple times when they send me emails or when I see their ads and they always have everything seemingly discounted on their website but actually the prices are more or less the same all the time. Which fools people into thinking they're getting a discount or that their stuff is more premium than it actually is. While that's probably good for temporary sales it's not good for getting recurrent customers.. So stop doing that Siroko and just post the real selling prices if you wanna become a genuinely good company.Shipping was very fast from Spain to Slovenia, the first shipment was only a day! The second one took just 3 days which is still great :)Date of experience: October 31, 2020",4,0.18,0.51

For whatever reason, as much as Siroko is more known for sunglasses, I found their jerseys to be good looking and have ordered 3 each at about $60-ish.  I'm not well experienced with jerseys, but I find these to be quite comfortable and well priced vs the big name brands.  Breathability could probably be improved a bit, and the zipper isn't my favorite, but those are probably my only complaints.  I'm not sure what I'm missing vs a e.g. Assos or Rapha or Castelli, but for the price these work well for me. I've ridden hours and hours in 100 degree heat and can honestly say that upper body comfort has never been an issue. Not bad for the price.

I was unsure but the online store looked serious and I also read the reviews which were good. I see that a few norwegians wrote bad reviews and tell you not to buy from Siroko or other international online stores. This is because Norway is a very very little country and they are afraid to loose customers. In Norway there is not a totally free market though they say there is. Its a little country run by traditional and nationalistic farmer mentality so that they can protect their communities. The government controls the most and have 1 shop for alcoholic beverages in the entire country which is called ‚Äú Vinmonopoli‚Äù. Yes, as you guessed, its monopoly.

Jesse,1 review,CA,"May 21, 2020","Great value and customer serviceI will join the recent positive reviews because of my good experience with Siroko. I ordered the K3 Africa with photochromic lens for mountain biking and they performed very well. The lens tint changed appropriately even with a visor on my helmet. I could see very well whether it was dark and cloudy, bright and sunny, or if I was in shaded trails. They keep my eyes protected and the lenses do not fog either thanks to vents at the top.Some people say the top of the K3 touches their forehead - this happened to me too if the arms were sitting on my ears. The key is to put the arms up a bit higher on your head so they angle forward. They will stay in place even on rough terrain.Unfortunately I forgot mine were on my head and when I took my hat off, they fell. I caught them before they could hit the ground, but the lens broke from the way I caught them against my body with my arm. Be careful with the lenses! I contacted Siroko and they said they will replace them! Very grateful for their support.I also want to say to be aware of customs charges. In my case, importing to Canada resulted in about $26 in customs fees, most of which was the broker fee. Still worth it.Overall great value for the money. I went with Siroko because I can't afford $250 big brand sunglasses but wanted good performance and eye protection. I am very happy with my decision.Date of experience: May 21, 2020",5,0.33,0.51

Przemyslaw Maciolek,2 reviews,PL,"May 19, 2020","Love the prescription glass insertsLet's be fair, Siroko does not produce the best sunglasses in the world. I got two sets so fair and have following observations:* the lens quality is pretty good - if Oakleys are 5/5, then Sirokos are easily 4/5, no major difference* the plastic quality is adequate but one needs to be careful when replacing lenses or so - the instructions need to be accurately followed and no extra force must be used - I learnt this by breaking my OptiClip insert (Siroko offered to send me a replacement free of charge - thank you!)When using Oakleys with contact lenses I always had objections on the vision quality. Even with best contact lenses intended for astigmatism I had non-ideal vision sharpness after several hours of ride. Sirokos with optical inserts (OptiClip) provide me overall much better vision clarity than Oakleys with contact lenses. And while the quality is not exactly the same, the price is competitive enough to justify a purchaseDate of experience: May 19, 2020",5,0.32,0.49

andre_g,2 reviews,SI,"May 6, 2020","OK for the price, but I won't buy againI ordered 2 pairs of cycling sunglasses both ""photochromic"". Overall ok sunglasses for 38‚Ç¨. Shipping and packing are very good, the frame is ok. But lenses are bad, they are spouses to get darker in the sun but they won't. Lenses are just normal a bit lighter version of normal sunglass lenses.  Also, frame is to fat in my opinion and it bothers me on ears and it squeezes too much after 4h bike right I get pain behind my ears.Compering these glasses to 150‚Ç¨ cycling sunglasses I also own and use for the last 5 years, is unfair because of the price difference.

The worst customer support i have ever deal with. This company is a true scam. I had bought 2 pairs of sunglasses and the both came defected. Siroko was not willing to replace them cause they didnt see any SERIOUS damage but only minor scratches. How insane is that? I bought NEW sunglasses and they say that scratches it was not something important. After a lot of complaining emails they say me that will change them but i have to pay again shipping cost to send them back to siroko and also the shipping cost to send me the new ones. INSANE. I was desperate so i pay for all this extra shipping cost and finally when i receive the new ones it was very different than those i see on the website. For example i choose a pair with black lenses and i receive one with yellow lenses. Their answer was that the company is on a changing phase. RIDICULOUS.

Balazs M.,9 reviews,IE,"Updated Jan 9, 2020","Avoid at any cost!!!That's a really good looking garbage. Bought 3 in March: for a friend, to my wife and for myself. 1 broke after 2 month, the 2nd one broke just a few days later and my own broke today. When I put it into the case it was in 1 piece, when I wanted to use it today, it was already broken. So no impact is needed for this low quality frame. Buy from well-known brands and forget Siroko, they do good marketing, but that's all, these glasses are useless. Or if you want something cheap, buy from Aldi or Lidl, both deliver much better quality.Tried to find something about warranty on the webpage, 0 results.Tried to contact their customer service, no response.IMPORTANT:if you payed via PayPal, you have 6 month to claim your money back. Maybe it will work, give it a try.Update:Siroko tried to remove my negative feedbacks. I think they should focus on customer feedbacks and quality improvements than disturbing dissatisfied customers.They also tried to contact me here 6 month after my complaint (not it relation with the complaint but the negative feedback), but previously they ignored all my emails so why should I care?You can find other reviews on Trustpilot if you search for siroko.com using the search field.Date of experience: July 28, 2019",1,-0.01,0.37

Style is great but frame quality is very poor and has a weak stress point requiring extreme caution when putting them on. Customer service was very good and they replaced the last two pairs quickly. After third breakage I've not bothered going back to them as I've lost complete faith in the product. I don't have a wide face but frames cannot tolerate any slight bend that would normally occur putting on glasses. The plastic has no flex and are brittle when they break. Friend of mine is an optician and he was with me when one pair snapped. He took a look at them and said the frame quality is poor and what you should expect from a cheap product. Such a shame as I like the design and lens quality is good but sadly let down by the frame.Date of experience: June 11, 2019",2,0.05,0.45

If it starts to rain the most appropriate is to remove them, store it; and before this dry with fabric cover.""So if it starts to rain you have to run or ride a bike without glasses.Incredible!!!Date of experience: April 10, 2019",1,0.26,0.61
Randy,3 reviews,US,"Apr 4, 2019","Bought a pair of the K3 The CyclistBought a pair of the K3 The Cyclist.  They shipped fast, and seemed like a good deal with good style.  I also purchased 2 of the optional lenses (clear and yellow).  For my first ride with them, I switched out the lenses using the directions.  They required an unreasonable amount of force to be placed on the nose piece to get the lens to seat in the upper recess.  The nose piece looks like VERY flimsy plastic.  On the second ride, I had to change the lenses again, but this time (again following the instructions) the nose piece snapped right off.  I had to glue the nose piece back on to finish my ride.  I tried to get a warranty, as I only got ONE ride with these glasses before they broke (following their instructions for lens change-out).  They denied the warranty, because the glasses had been modified (glued back together).  Mind you, they broke BEFORE the glue, and the company was informed that they were only glued to safely finish a long distance ride.  It's not like they would be able to fix them if they weren't glued.  They just wanted an excuse not to stand behind their product.  So, BEWARE!  Don't buy these thinking that you can change the lenses.  And consider them disposable, because they don't stand behind their products.Date of experience: April 04, 2019",1,0.11,0.39
